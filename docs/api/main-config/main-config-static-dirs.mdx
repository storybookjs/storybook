<CodeSnippets path="main-config-static-dirs.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Callout variant="info">
When using Vite-based frameworks, additional directories may be copied to your build directory because of Vite's own [static asset handling](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#the-public-directory). You can set Vite's `publicDir` option to `false` to disable this behavior.
</Callout>

## With configuration objects

You can also use a configuration object to define the directories:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="main-config-static-dirs-with-object.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}
