# Story-docs open service (`core/story-docs`)

Per-story snippets, descriptions, and file-level import statements for docs pages, the Code
panel, and the components HTML debugger. Component prop docgen lives in the sibling `core/docgen`
service.

When `experimentalDocgenServer` is enabled, the server, manager, and preview register the same open
service. Provider-extracted component payloads live under `components`; they are the service's only
state. The sibling browser-only [`core/dynamic-snippets`](../dynamic-snippets/README.md) service owns
args-aware source records and their manager-facing preview transforms.

Static builds serialize one component payload per `storyDocs` query input. Browser consumers fetch
that snapshot through the same query contract.

## Import snippets

Story-docs builds import statements from CSF import analysis, shared across providers by
`buildImportStatements` in `csf-tools`.

Where they end up differs by provider. React and Vue set the payload-level `import` field, which
`selectSnippetForStory` prepends to the story snippet. Angular instead emits a self-contained
snippet: its snippet is a host component that already carries its own imports, so prepending a
second import block would produce source that does not parse. New providers should follow Angular
and leave `import` unset; the field stays until React and Vue move over, and goes away with them.

The component `@import` JSDoc override tag is honored only where a provider already reads the
component source. Angular reads it from the docgen payload's JSDoc tags; React and Vue derive
imports from resolved import paths and package name rewriting only.
