  title: Migrating from test-runner
---

The [test-runner](../test-runner.mdx) was created back in 2021 to enable users to run stories as tests. It is a solution which uses Jest as runner and Playwright as browser environment. Over the years, Storybook has evolved and introduced many testing related concepts, including a [Vitest-based testing solution](./index.mdx), a spiritual successor to the test-runner. Alongside it, we released a testing widget, allowing users to run tests directly from Storybook's UI and get reports such as a11y and coverage.

You **do not** have to change how you write your stories between the test-runner and the Vitest addon.

This guide explains how to migrate an existing project using `@storybook/test-runner` to the `@storybook/addon-vitest`.

## Is my project eligible to upgrade?

The [Vitest addon](./index.mdx) is supported and recommended for [React](?renderer=react), [Preact](?renderer=preact), [Vue](?renderer=vue), [Svelte](?renderer=svelte), and [Web Components](?renderer=web-components) projects, which use the [Vite builder](../../../builders/vite.mdx) (or the [Next.js framework with Vite](../../get-started/frameworks/nextjs.mdx#with-vite)).

If you are using a different renderer (such as Angular) or the Webpack builder, you should continue to use the [test runner](../test-runner.mdx) to test your stories.

## Migration steps

Below you will find steps on the migration, and alongside it you can use [this commit as reference](https://github.com/yannbf/test-runner-migration-example/commit/cb0ddd5137021a7ed25d15f8d23c6c5e2d01513e) as an example of project being migrated.

### 1. Remove test-runner dependencies

Remove the following dependencies:

- `@storybook/test-runner` dependency
- `@storybook/addon-coverage` dependency (if present)

### 2. Remove test-runner related files

Remove the following files:

- `test-runner-jest.config.js` file (if present)
- `.storybook/test-runner.ts` file (if present)
  - If you had configured accessibility testing, this is now done out of the box with the Vitest addon.
  - If you had configured image snapshot testing, check [this FAQ](#what-if-i-am-doing-image-snapshot-testing).
  - If you had configuration for custom, advanced use cases such as using [the `prepare` hook](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner#prepare), please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook) or open a [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/new/choose) so we can assist you with the migration.

### 3. Set up `@storybook/addon-vitest`

- Run this command, which will set up all the necessary code for you.
  
  <CodeSnippets path="addon-test-install.md" />
  
- Update the `package.json` script for Storybook tests, replacing the test-runner binary and using Vitest instead:

  ```diff
  {
    "scripts": {
  -    "test-storybook": "test-storybook"
  +    "test-storybook": "vitest --project=storybook"
    }
  }
  ```

- Visit [the Vitest addon guide](./index.mdx) to learn how to use it, how to configure it, and how it works.

Tips:

1. If you previously used `--coverage` with the test-runner, use Vitest’s coverage instead: `vitest --project=storybook --coverage`.
2. Add more browsers by extending [`instances` field](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/config.html#browser-instances) in the Vitest configuration file (e.g., `firefox`, `webkit`).

### 4. Update your CI to run Vitest instead of the test-runner

If you're using the Storybook test-runner in CI, replace its build/serve/wait flow with a single Vitest command. For example, in GitHub Actions:

```diff
# .github/workflows/storybook-tests.yml
name: 'Storybook Tests'

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
-      - name: Build Storybook
-        run: yarn build-storybook --quiet
-      - name: Serve Storybook and run tests
-        run: |
-          npx concurrently -k -s first -n "SB,TEST" -c "magenta,blue" \
-            "npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent" \
-            "npx wait-on tcp:127.0.0.1:6006 && yarn test-storybook --coverage"
+      - name: Run storybook tests
+        run: |
+          npx vitest --project=storybook
```

If you want coverage in CI, run `vitest --project=storybook --coverage`.

For other CI providers and for more detailed configuration info, check the [testing in CI guide](../../in-ci.mdx#2-add-a-new-ci-workflow).

## Conclusion

While the test-runner was limited to running tests via the CLI, the Vitest addon opens up multiple ways to run and interact with your tests:

- The testing widget in Storybook's UI
- Vitest CLI
- Vitest IDE integrations

For more details, check the [Vitest addon guide](./index.mdx#usage).

Finally, a summary of the changes and benefits you gain by migrating to the Vitest addon:

- Vitest is used as a runner instead of Jest, which modernizes your codebase and executes tests much faster.
- Stories seamlessly integrate as tests in your Vitest setup, significantly simplifying your component test configuration.
- There is no need to build and run Storybook to run tests, which makes the set up faster and more portable.
- Tests are still tested in a Playwright environment, but in [Vitest's Browser mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/).
- Accessibility testing comes out of the box and integrates with the Storybook testing widget and Accessibility addon panel.
- Code coverage comes out of the box and does not require instrumentation from the `@storybook/addon-coverage` package which makes your stories render faster.

## FAQ

### What if I am using Storybook with Webpack or RsPack?

In this case, it's advised to keep using the `@storybook/test-runner`.

### What if I am using Jest for my unit tests?

You can still migrate to use Vitest, but if you believe that you won't benefit from that, you can keep using the `@storybook/test-runner`..

### What if I am doing image snapshot testing?

There are solutions for image snapshot testing that integrate with the Storybook testing widget:

- On the cloud with the [Visual tests addon](../../visual-testing.mdx)
- Locally with [`storybook-addon-vis`](https://github.com/repobuddy/visual-testing)
