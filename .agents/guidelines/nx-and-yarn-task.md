# NX and `yarn task`

This document is canonical for NX and the `yarn task` runner: caching, task dependencies, sandbox and CI-parity flags, and the environment variable reference. `AGENTS.md` owns the pointer to this file and the common commands.

Use NX when you want better caching and dependency tracking. Prefer these faster defaults first, and only add `-c production` or `--no-link` when you specifically need sandbox parity or CI-like behavior.

```bash
# Compile all packages
yarn task compile
yarn nx run-many -t compile

# Check all packages
yarn task check
yarn nx run-many -t check

# Run E2E tests for a template
yarn task e2e-tests-dev --template react-vite/default-ts --start-from auto
yarn nx e2e-tests-dev react-vite/default-ts -c production

# Jump to a later step
yarn task e2e-tests-dev --start-from e2e-tests --template react-vite/default-ts
yarn nx e2e-tests-dev -c production --exclude-task-dependencies
```

Key points:

- `-c production` is required for sandbox-related NX commands and CI-parity runs
- `react-vite/default-ts` is the default sandbox template
- `--no-link` is opt-in, not the default
- NX handles task dependencies via `nx.json`
- NX target commands use Nx project names (from `project.json` / Nx graph), not `package.json` names
- Example: `yarn nx compile core` (project `core` is published as package `storybook`)
- NX Cloud remote-cache auth failures (e.g. HTTP 401 "insufficient access") degrade to the local cache, so they are expected on local runs where `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` is unset. CI always sets that token, so a 401 there means an invalid or expired token and should be investigated rather than ignored. A read-only token enables cache reads but cannot store artifacts, so the "wasn't able to store" warning is still expected with one
