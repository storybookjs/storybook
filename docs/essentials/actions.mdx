Actions are used to show that an event handler (callback) has been called, and to display its arguments. The actions panel can show both story args and other function calls.

## Story args
Actions work via supplying special Storybook-generated mock functions to your story's event handler args. There are two ways to get an action arg:

### Via storybook/test fn spies

The recommended way to write actions is to use the `fn` utility from `storybook/test` to mock and spy args. This is very useful for writing [interaction tests](../writing-tests/interaction-testing.mdx). You can mock your component's methods by assigning them to the `fn()` function:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="button-story-onclick-action-spy.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

If your component calls an arg (because of either the user's interaction or the `play` function) and that arg is spied on, the event will show up in the action panel:

### Automatically matching args

Another option is to use a global parameter to match all [argTypes](../api/arg-types.mdx) that match a certain pattern. The following configuration automatically creates actions for each `on` argType (which you can either specify manually or can be [inferred automatically](../api/arg-types.mdx#automatic-argtype-inference)).

This is quite useful when your component has dozens (or hundreds) of methods and you do not want to manually apply the `fn` utility for each of those methods. However, **this is not the recommended** way of writing actions. That's because automatically inferred args **are not available as spies in your play function**. If you use `argTypesRegex` and your stories have play functions, you will need to also define args with the `fn` utility to test them in your play function.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-matching-argtypes.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

If you need more granular control over which `argTypes` are matched, you can adjust your stories and include the `argTypesRegex` parameter. For example:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="button-story-matching-argtypes.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This will bind a standard HTML event handler to the outermost HTML element rendered by your component and trigger an action when the event is called for a given selector. The format is `<eventname> <selector>`. The selector is optional; it defaults to all elements.



## Non-story function calls

You can still use the actions panel if you need to log function calls that are unrelated to any story. This can be helpful for debugging or logging purposes. There are two main ways to do this: `spyOn` from `storybook/test` or the `action` function from `storybook/actions`. For basic logging, we recommend creating a function spy, and for more complex scenarios, you can use the `action` function directly.

### Via storybook/test spyOn

Mocks and spies  from `storybook/test` are automatically logged as actions. The easiest way to show function calls in the actions panel is to use `spyOn`. Spies appear with a default name, which you can customise by calling the `mockName` method.

<CodeSnippets path="actions-spyon-basic-example.md" />


### Via the `action` function

You may want to filter which function calls are logged as actions based on the received parameters. Since `spyOn` logs all function calls, it is not suitable. To disable that behavior, you'll need to disable the default mock name. Then, provide a mock implementation where you check the parameters and manually call `action` from the `storybook/actions` module when you want to log an action.

## API

### Parameters

This contributes the following [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.mdx) to Storybook, under the `actions` namespace:

#### `argTypesRegex`

Type: `string`

Create actions for each arg that matches the regex. Please note the significant [limitations of this approach](#automatically-matching-args), as described above.

#### `disable`

Type: `boolean`

Disable the action panel.

This parameter is most useful to allow overriding at more specific levels. For example, if this parameter is set to `true` at the project level, it could then be re-enabled by setting it to `false` at the meta (component) or story level.

### Exports

```js
import { action } from 'storybook/actions';
```

#### `action`

Type: `(name?: string) => void`

Allows you to create an action that appears in the actions panel of the Storybook UI when clicked. The action function takes an optional name parameter, which is used to identify the action in the UI.
