  title: CSF Factories (Experimental)

CSF Factories are the next evolution of Storybook's Component Story Format (CSF). This new API uses a pattern called factory functions to provide full type safety to your Storybook stories, making it easier to configure addons correctly and unlocking the full potential of Storybook's features.

While this feature is experimental, we will be documenting progress in the [RFC](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/30112). We welcome your feedback!
