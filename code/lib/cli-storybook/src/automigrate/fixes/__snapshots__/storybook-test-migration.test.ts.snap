"We detected that you're using @storybook/test in your project. This package has been merged into storybook/test.

We'll help you migrate by:
1. Removing @storybook/test from your dependencies
2. Updating all imports from @storybook/test to storybook/test

We'll scan the following files:
- All files in .storybook directory
- All *.stories.* files
- All *.test.* files

The default glob pattern we'll use is: {.storybook/**/*,**/*.{stories.*,test.*}}

In the next step, you can provide a custom glob pattern to fine-tune the files we'll scan."
