 *
 * The single source of truth for the derived booleans, shared by the runtime's subscription
 * emissions and `useServiceQuery`'s first-render seed so they can never drift apart. The booleans
 * intentionally follow our `load` vocabulary: `isLoading` is "any load in flight" (TanStack's
 * `isFetching`) and `isInitialLoading` is "the first load with nothing to show yet".
 *
 * Unlike TanStack Query, a subscription here can attach to a query whose `data` is already cached in
 * service state (e.g. revisiting an already-extracted component): its per-subscription lifecycle
 * still starts `pending`/`loading`, but `data` is present from the first emission. `isInitialLoading`
 * therefore also requires `data === undefined`, so consumers gate a "nothing yet" skeleton on it
 * without flashing it over already-available data while a background (re)load runs.

/**
 * Builds the synthetic first-render {@link QueryState} for a subscription hook, from a pure
 * `query.get(input)` read.
 *
 * Subscription hooks must return a {@link QueryState} on their very first render, before the
 * subscription's first emission has delivered the real lifecycle (`useSyncExternalStore` reads the
 * snapshot during render; the React 16-compatible preview hooks read it synchronously too). `get()`
 * returns only data (no lifecycle, no load), so we pair it with a `pending`/`loading` status as a
 * placeholder until the subscription delivers the real lifecycle moments later. A throw from
 * `get()` (e.g. input validation) becomes an `error` state — mirroring what the subscription would
 * emit — so the hook never throws during render.
 *
 * Shared by the manager-side `useServiceQuery` and the preview-side docs hooks so their first-render
 * seeds can never drift apart.
 *
 * Only the query's `get` method is needed, so the parameter is narrowed to that shape: `TOutput` then
 * infers purely (and reliably) from `get`'s return type, rather than through the contravariant
 * positions of the full `Query` type — which would widen `TOutput` and break callers that pass a
 * query with a hand-written payload type.
